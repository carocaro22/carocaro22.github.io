<b>What is neural Network in essence? </b><br \>
A Neural Network is a machine learning algorithm with a specific architecture <br \>
<b>What is a Perceptron? </b><br \> 
- Perceptron is a machine learning algorithm. <br \>
- We should use it when a dataset is linearly separable. <br \>
<b>What is transfer learning? </b><br \>
"Transfer learning is the improvement of learning in a new task through the transfer of knowledge from a related task that has already been learned"<br \>
<b>What is Gradient Descent</b><br \>
Remember Baske multivariable calculus. A descent gradient is just a negative Gradient.<br \>
<b>Why is sgn(x) not differentiable?</b><br \>
Think about the way this function looks like. This function has a sharp point. It has an instantaneous change in the function slope.<br \>
<b>What is a basic unit?</b><br \>
